## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I recalled some of the implementations from my previous tasks. 

### Continued development

I want to continue developing with HTML, CSS and Javascript, on a couple of projects. I want to truly learn responsive web development. 

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me with implementing some compontents in the solution. like making certian sections of the text be bold, I used the b tag and hr tag I used for the line that is acting as a divider.
- [Deque University](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.6/region?application=axeAPI) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the landmarks. I'd recommend it to anyone who is still new to HTML or coding.
- [Piccalilli](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/) - I have referenced how to reset css from this site.
